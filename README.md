# btc-algo
This project focuses on creating a basic momentum algorithm for trading bitcoin (can eventually be applied to any crypto). This README file will provide an overview of the project, and markdown cells within the notebook provide further details.

## Abstract


## Introduction
I started this project because I wanted to learn how to create a working trading algorithm, and I chose to use cryptocurrencies because Coinbase Pro has a very user-friendly and free API for retreiving data about cryptos. After reading about popular trading algorithms, I chose to experiment with a momentum algorithm due to its simplicity and flexibility. I read that a good way to implement a momentum based algo is to choose two different interval moving averages (e.g. 5 minutes and 20 minutes), and to buy the crypto when the shorter average is higher than the longer average and sell if the opposite occurs. I first coded this algorithm, and then analyzed historic bitcoin data in attempt to optimize the algorithm using the best possible intervals for the moving averages.
